Our group worked collaboratively on this lab and portfolio entirely on replit.com. The site allowed multiple users to edit files in real time and view the changes made to our webpage. 

Namely, we started by "converting" our previous site over to php, which allowed for us to use repeated code with ease. Initially, we thought that we would need to have all of our page components separate from each other, however, we realized that we could just write html normally into the php files. 

Regarding challenges - we ran into some issues with css components overlapping because they were given common names, however, we resolved the issue by using ids. It was giving us an error because the code that she referenced used elements that were generic, so it was causing all of the <li> tags to have x-boxes next to them. I was able to have the js check the parent element so that it would only add it to those that had a certain id above them. 
  
Also, our project ended up diverging from our initial wireframes, and so it was a little bit difficult to see where the project was going sometimes. We needed to talk about the structure of our webpages and if this front-end is what we really wanted to see in our product. We understand that our project will develop over the course of this semester, and with that, our front-end will change too.
